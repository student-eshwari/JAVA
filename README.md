# JAVA
this is my second repository

// 1st program
 This program finds the pair of elements whose sum is equals to a given target value in sorted or rotated array

//2nd program
This program finds the maximum profit that can be made from a single stock transaction. Given an array where each element represents the stock price on a particular day, the goal is to choose one day to buy and a later day to sell to achieve the highest profit. If no profit is possible, the program returns 0.
